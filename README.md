Raw data, which has been acquired with the Rational Approximation of Golden Angles (RAGA) Sampling, can universally be converted into three different data formats:

* Full Frame (`FF`) Format
* Time-Resolved Retrospectively Binned Zero-Filled Full Frames (`TFF`) Format
* Time-Resolved Retrospectively Binned Compressed (`TC`) Format

allowing for reconstructing static or dynamic data without any additional information about the projection angle.
The raw data includes all this information directly.

Nevertheless, when being transformed in [BART](https://github.com/mrirecon/bart)'s default `FF` format, additional information is required to transform it into the `TFF` and `TC` format for time-resolved reconstructions.

This tutorial provides guidance of how to transform data into the individual formats and gives some examples of how to reconstruct them.

### About the Tutorial

The tutorial can run on the CPU only, but it is highly recommended to have a GPU. The examples have been optimized for the Google Colab service providing the hardware infrastructure including a GPU. If you want to run the scripts on a CPU remove the `-g` flags from all `nufft`, `pics`, and `rtnlinv` commands.
